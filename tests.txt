STEPS:
* Get used to the simulator.
* Record my first data set.
* Upload to AWS, extract, and update the path as seeing in class.
* Create simple network and save model to check everything is working.
* Normalize and mean center data.
* LeNet architecture.
* Data augmentation with mirroring.
* Record a second dataset using the mouse.
* Data augmentation with side cameras data: goes straight, the follows right sideline, then out.
* Use additional datasets record recovery steering angles from side to center: car is steering to hard now.
* Cropping images to remove top and car hood.
* Do one more lap around first track.
* Try more powerful architecture.


* Use second track as training set too.
